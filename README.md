# Arthur and the Staff of Arbitrary Arrangement
[Arthur and the Staff of Arbitrary Arrangement](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=26987) - Ludum Dare 32 Compo Entry

Venture far into the depths of the unknown, this is your destiny. You have but one companion, the Staff of Arbitrary Arrangement; to everything else, you are but a rat in the basement. 

Use the staff to translocate with any physical object. To complete your quest, this ability must be used with both finesse and caution. Falling off a ledge will kill you. Getting attacked by a zombie will kill you. Getting attacked by a fast zombie will kill you faster. Getting shot by a skeleton archer will kill you. Accidentally translocating into that one zombie you just tricked into running off the edge... will kill you. Good luck. 

Press onward Arthur... Do not go gentle into that good night. 


Controls:  
WASD - Move.  
Mouse - Aim.  
Mouse 1 - Fire translocation bolt - if it makes contact with any object, you and that object will swap places.  

Objective:  
Discover just how deep the rabbit-hole goes.  

Toolset:  
Game Logic: Libgdx/Eclipse  
Image Assets: Photoshop  
Sound/Music: There's no sound. Spooky dungeons are silent. Obviously. Have you ever been in a spooky dungeon before? With fast zombies... you don't hear them coming.
